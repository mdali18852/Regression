        "\n",
        "When a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model has a high R² but a low adjusted R², it often indicates a potential problem with the model, specifically related to overfitting. Let's break down the key concepts to understand why this happens.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Understanding R² and Adjusted R²:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**R² (Coefficient of Determination):**\n",
        "\n",
        "R² measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "A high R² suggests that the model fits the data well, i.e., it explains a large proportion of the variability in the dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Adjusted R²:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Adjusted R² adjusts the R² value by penalizing the model for including too many predictors (independent variables), especially if they do not add meaningful predictive power.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike R², which always increases as more predictors are added to the model, adjusted R² can decrease if unnecessary variables are included.\n",
        "\n",
        "It provides a more accurate measure of model performance when comparing models with different numbers of predictors.\n",

        "**22. Why is it important to scale variables in Multiple Linear Regression ?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Scaling variables in Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is important because it ensures that all predictors are on a similar scale, which can affect the model's performance, interpretability, and statistical validity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Reasons for Scaling Variables in MLR:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Equal Weight for Each Predictor:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In MLR, the coefficients represent the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable. If the predictors have very different units or ranges (e.g., one variable is in dollars and another is in years), the model may give undue weight to variables with larger numerical ranges. Scaling ensures that all predictors contribute equally to the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Improved Convergence in Optimization Algorithms:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Many regression models, particularly when using gradient descent for optimization, require that the predictors be on similar scales. If one variable has a much larger range than another, the optimization process can become slow or unstable. Scaling helps the algorithm converge faster and more reliably.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Better Interpretation of Coefficients:**\n",
        "\n",
        "When the predictors are on different scales, comparing the size of the coefficients can be misleading. Scaling the variables (e.g., using standardization or normalization) makes the coefficients comparable, allowing for a clearer interpretation of the relative importance of each variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Multicollinearity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Multicollinearity occurs when predictors are highly correlated, and it can lead to unstable coefficient estimates. While scaling doesn’t directly eliminate multicollinearity, it can help in detecting and managing it more effectively, as scaled variables can make it easier to spot patterns in correlation matrices.\n",
        "\n",
        "**23. What is polynomial regression ?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Polynomial Regression is a type of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial rather than a straight line. It is used when the relationship between variables is curvilinear (i.e., not simply linear), and helps to model more complex relationships between the predictors and the outcome.\n",
